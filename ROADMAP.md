# 🚀 AI Creator Studio Roadmap

## 🚨 Critical Infrastructure (The "Hammer Down" Phase)
- [ ] **The Engine Matrix:** Split AI Logic into 3 distinct settings:
    - **Ideation Engine:** Optimized for speed/creativity.
    - **Research Engine:** Optimized for large context (reading files).
    - **Writer Engine:** Optimized for human tone/prose.
- [ ] **Model Playground:** A testing arena to compare outputs side-by-side before committing.
- [ ] **Error Handling 2.0:** Replace all `alert()` boxes with proper Toast notifications (Success/Error/Loading).
- [ ] **Button States:** ALL buttons must show "Loading..." spinners and disable themselves to prevent double-clicks.

## Phase 1: The Core Engine
- [x] **Service Adapter Factory:** Switch between Gemini/OpenAI/Claude.
- [x] **Channel DNA:** Persistent brand voice and visual settings.
- [x] **Knowledge Well:** RAG system to inject facts into scripts.
- [ ] **Search Intelligence:** Generate search queries based on Project Overview.
- [ ] **Negative Prompting:** "Anti-Cliche" filter (Avoid: "Delve", "Tapestry", "Elevate").

## Phase 2: Workflow Refinement
- [ ] **Research-First Flow:** Ideation -> Overview/Research -> Script Generation.
- [ ] **The "Editor" Agent:** A separate AI pass to revise/punch up the first draft.
- [ ] **Competitor DNA Scraper:** Analyze successful channels to auto-generate DNA profiles.
- [ ] **Format Converter:** One-click convert Script 16:9 -> 9:16 (Shorts/Reels).

## Phase 3: UX Polish
- [ ] **Delete Confirmation:** Modal popup to prevent accidental project deletion.
- [ ] **Mobile Porting:** Capacitor.js wrap.
- [ ] **Review Mode:** "Teleprompter" view for recording.

## Known Bugs (To Fix)
- [x] Fix "New Project" button on Dashboard.
- [x] Fix "Regenerate Script" API connection.
- [ ] **Ideation:** Brainstorm button needs better error feedback.
